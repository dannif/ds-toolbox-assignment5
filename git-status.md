Definition: git status:

The bash command git status displays the state of the working branch and the staging area.  It shows the files that are staged, not staged and untracked by Git. It suggests you to use "git add <file> ..." to include the untracked files that will be committed.  

The git status is useful for seeing which files are staged for commit and the files that are untracked which will not be committed unless you add them.  It helps to get review that the correct files are being staged and to be committed.
    
The same information can be found in JupyterLab IDE by clicking the Git tab on the left.  Under "Changes" tab, one can see the files which are Staged, Changed and Untracked.
